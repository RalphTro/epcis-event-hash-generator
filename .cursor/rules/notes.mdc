# AI Notes

The `.cursor/notes` folder contains notes about the project.
The notes form a knowledge base about the project to be used by the AI Agents working on the project. They should help you when working with the same code again in the future.

**Always find and read relevant notes before executing a task and update your notes afterwards!**

## Read notes before reading anything else

- Before you analyse files, in particular before you start searching files or analysing the general project structure, consult your notes.
  - The notes contain an `index.md` file which is to help you to quickly find the relevant information. In particular this file points you to the right notes files for specific topics.

## Update Notes with new knowledge

- After you learn anything about the code base, e.g. after analyzing any files or finishing tasks, check the notes folder for a file with related content to what you have just learned.
  - If there is no such file, create a mark down file with a suitable (i.e. topic related) name.
  - Add a concise summary of what you have learned to your notes file.
  - Update the notes index and make sure that your knowledge is properly referenced so that you can easily find it.
- After updating the notes, deduplicate content, also across multiple notes files.
  - Update the `index.md`.
  - The index should in particular contain a brief summary of the projects folder structure and information about what files and folders are related to which sub projects/parts/features/functionality.
  - The index should at least contain a link to every other file in the notes directory with a brief description of the purpose and content of that file.

## Housekeeping after each update

- Keep the notes tidy, well structured and concise.
- The notes should contain general notes about styles, strategies, code structures, and general behavioral hints like which tools to use.
  - Notes should not be too detailed. Rather reference source files from notes than including too many details.
- The notes should not contain individual changelog about details that have been changed. There are dedicated Changelog.md files for this kind of information.
  - Do not write historical notes about changes into the notes, only describe the current state.
- Before adding notes content or new files, consider if reading them in the future will be helpful for you to understand the project more quickly.
  - Do not pollute the notes folder with distracting information or superficial descriptions which are easily derived from sources. Rather just reference where to find such information.
- After adding notes, try to consolidate all `.cursor/notes`.
  - Rather keep summaries and key words than long text.
  - Try to reduce the number of notes files by joining files which cover similar topics.
- Remember to always keep the `index.md` up to date
